# Creating a Base renderer class using Vulkan to Use in further projects

Followed [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) until the chapter [Depth Buffering](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Depth_buffering).
Since it is a monolith, I want to clean up the code by creating other classes and a final Renderer class which other projects can interface with.
